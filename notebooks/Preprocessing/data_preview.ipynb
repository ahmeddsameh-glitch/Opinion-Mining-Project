    "text = \"I recently watched the new action movie and honestly, it was thrilling from start to finish. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat, and the acting was top-notch. However, I felt the soundtrack didn’t quite match the intensity of the scenes. The movie was released in May 2023 and runs for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes. It grossed over $300 million worldwide in its first week. Many critics praised the director for his bold choices, while some audiences thought the pacing was too fast. Personally, I think the cinematography was stunning, especially in the desert scenes. According to IMDb, the film has a rating of 7.8 out of 10.The lead actor previously starred in a hit sci-fi franchise.In my opinion, this is his best performance yet.\"\n",
